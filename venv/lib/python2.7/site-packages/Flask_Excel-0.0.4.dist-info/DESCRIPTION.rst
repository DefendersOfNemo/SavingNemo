**Flask-Excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_ and makes
it easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as
well as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into a list of lists,
a list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence it
lets you focus on data in Flask based web development, instead of file formats.

The idea originated from the problem of the illiteracy of excel file formats of
non-technical office workers: such as office assistant, human resource administrator.
There is nothing with the un-deniable fact that some people do not know the
difference among various excel formats. It becomes usability problem to those
people when a web service cannot parse the excel file that they saved using
Microsoft Excel. Instead of training those people about file formats, this library
helps web developers to handle most of the excel file formats by unifying the
programming interface to most of the excel readers and writers.

The highlighted features are:

#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data struture
#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download
#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side
#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via the following plugins:
